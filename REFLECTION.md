Before I started this project, I assumed that I had enough knowledge of react and express, and this app would be quite simple. 
In reality, there was a still a lot I needed to learn to solve many of the tasks required in this assignment! 
 
I was constantly having to refer to documentation on how to implement aspects of react that I didn't know like React Router, react hooks etc. 
There was also a large amount of functionality that I needed consider and plan in order to find the solutions. 
having to stop and consider the best solution to new problems instead of relying on prior experience and knowledge slowed my progress significantly. 

I feel my strongest skill in this project was my knowledge of native javascript methods and data types, which meant that I was able to convert and pass data without too much consideration.

The largest problems I encountered with this assignment were:
- The time constraint,
- under-estimating the  complexity of certain aspects of the app.
- finding up to date & accurate information in a timely manner to fill the gaps in my knowledge.

With the amount of time I spent researching and considering solutions, I ran out of time to work on the JSON api.

If time was not a concern, I am confident I could to deliver both projects. 
On the other hand, I could finish the projects much sooner if I had learnt the concepts properly before starting.
