#### Rules for this assessment

See RULES.md

#### Second opinion

#### Start time:

START_TIME

#### Deadline:

DEADLINE

#### Passing grade:

45 / 60 points

#### How to make and submit your homework

- Use `npx create-react-app` to create new react app
- Add this briefing to your repo as `BRIEFING.md`
- `create-react-app` will initialize a git repository for you, so don't make one yourself
- Go to `github.com` and
  - create a new `private` repository
  - make sure **NOT** to initalize with a readme / .gitignore as it will give you errors when you will try to push
  - Add the evaluator to your repository as a `collaborator` (if you don't know who the evaluator will be: ask)
- Add your newly created git repository as a remote to your react app
- Push the initial version of your app created by `create-react-app`
- Start your react app with `npm run start`, as usual and start programming.
- You are allowed to leave `console.log`s and comments in your code, but please make your code reasonably indented/formatted, and remove unnecessary code. This will make your teachers happy :)
- Your teachers will also be happy if you make enough git commits. This way, we can see your progress. You get a point for committing at least once per section.

## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the learning goals we will be testing:

- Creating components
- Composing components and passing them data via props
- Using `event listeners` and `event handlers`
- Designing and managing component local state with `useState` hook
- Using the `useEffect` hook to fetch data
- Using `react-router-dom` to make static and dynamic routes
- Lifting state to a parent component, and passing callback props to children
- Making controlled forms
- Mapping, filtering, finding & sorting arrays of objects
- Making an express server that serves JSON
- Using npm to install packages, run scripts and write your own npm scripts (e.g. npm run dev)
- Basic git usage, making commits, adding remote & pushing to master

If this sounds like a large list, it is, and it's because you've learned a tremendous amount of things these past week! Don't let it scare or overwhelm you though, you have seen all these things. Don't hesitate to use the reader, Google (Stackoverlow), or the documentation links we provide below.

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating homework experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.

## What are we building?

We are building a webapp with articles about programming called `new News()`. It has 4 main pages

- A homepage with the latest article
- A page where you can search articles
- A page where you can read an article and leave comments
- A page that lists articles from a specific category

In addition we build the JSON api using express so our articles / comments data can be requested from a server.

## Api

The data for this app is already available through an api. This way you can build your entire app without having to have a working api yourself.

Overview of the entire api

Endpoints:

GET /articles

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/articles-comments-data/articles

GET /articles/:articleId

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/articles-comments-data/articles/1

GET /articles/:articleId/comments

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/articles-comments-data/articles/1/comments

GET /categories/:categorId/articles

https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/articles-comments-data/categories/devops/articles

A JSON with all the data:

## Wireframe

You will be provided with a wireframe that shows an overview of the app along with this README

## Features

### 1. As a reader I want to be able to navigate to different pages so I can find the information I am looking for

- The app should have a logo of the site on all pages which a user can click to go to the `Homepage`
- The homepage contains a button to go to the `Search Articles` page
- There is a `Category page` which has a dynamic route.
- There is an `Article detail page` which has a dynamic route.

| Criteria                                                                   | Points |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 2 Static Routes are implemented using react router                         | 1      |
| There is 1 dynamic route implemented with a route parameter for categoryId | 1      |
| There is 1 dynamic route implemented with a route parameter for articleId  | 1      |
| Each route renders a different component                                   | 1      |
| A new News() logo can be clicked on all pages to go to the `Homepage`      | 1      |

**Note:** If you are unable to implement routing in the app, you may put (render) the components for all the other features in App.js without using Routing at all.

**Note:** The new News() logo can be some text

### 2. As a reader I want to be able to read the latest article, so I can stay up to date

### 6. Express server

- So far we've been using the api which is already online. We can also create this api ourselves using express.
- Your React can make use of the api which is already online, your React app does not have to fetch data from your own api.
- Your own express api should return the same data as the one that is already online.
- All api endpoints should respond with JSON (not HTML)
- The entire set of data from the api is available from the following api endpoint:

  - Make a file called `ASSESSMENT.md`
  - Copy the rubric below into it
  - Score your assessment in the column `Self`
  - Leave room for the evaluator to fill in the `Evaluator` column
- Write a reflection about this assessment & your learning process in `REFLECTION.md`:
  - What did you do well, process wise
  - What would you do differently next time to improve, process wise
- Commit your code and use messages when you commit, push it to your respository using `git push origin master`
